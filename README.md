Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail

Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.

Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.
